      A great place to sit and chat with old friends and find new ones over a
      cup of tea- the canteen is easily the most happening and busiest place in
      college, no matter what time it is. Apart from finding your go-to snack
      here, the people running this place will also warm your heart; there's
      nothing more satisfying than running to the canteen in your short breaks
      and the canteen uncle knowing exactly what you want! The thrill of sitting
      here and finishing records or doing last minute revisions is
      unexplainable. From the rushed plate of idly in the morning to the one
      final frankie at the end of the day, this place will become your default
      hangout spot before you know it!
