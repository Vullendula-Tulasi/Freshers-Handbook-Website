<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Placement Office of CBIT takes up the top two floors of the
Student Amenities Block. Apart from hosting the training
sessions and activities, this is where most, if not all the
interviews take place. All the group discussions, aptitude tests
and career counselling sessions are also held here. The block
absolutely lights up during the placement season.</p>
