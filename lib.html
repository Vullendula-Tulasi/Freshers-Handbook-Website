      Library and Information Centre of CBIT is not just known for it's mini
      cameo in the fan-favorite "Happy Days" but also the bajillion times it has
      rescued students during last-minute batting. Rightfully titled as the best
      library in the entirety of South India, CBIT's information center was
      inaugurated by YSR himself. Replete with a diverse collection of
      comprehensive books, reference memos in ginormous amounts and computers,
      the building has its own tranquil ambiance making it the perfect place to
      study. For an ambitious engineer, this is the place to be for sure!
